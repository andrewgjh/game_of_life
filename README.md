# Conways Game of Life Exercise

Hosted on [Firebase](https://conway-gol.web.app/)

Conways game of Life is Zero Player Game which simulates how life progress through generations given the surrounding living conditions.

## The Rules of Life are:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Game Conditions

1.  You are able to set the grid size
2.  You can start or stop the simulation to set how life is going at any given generation.
3.  You are able to add or remove life during simulation to imitate the role of a divine power.
